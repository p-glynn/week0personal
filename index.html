    <p id="about">
      Hello! My name is Patrick. <br>I was born in beautiful Boulder, Colorado. <br>I like to do stuff outside, listen to music, and think about how to make the world a cooler place. <br>One of the most important things to me is family. <br>Here is a photo of me and a small part of my family from one of our annual Thanksgiving gatherings. <br>I am in the front in the purple shirt.
